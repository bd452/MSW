# Bug Check Analysis

## Checked Items

- [X] Host Platform
  - [X] WinRunSpiceBridge production binding
    - [X] Replace mock timer stream with libspice-glib delegate plumbing
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** Platform selection correctly uses `LibSpiceStreamTransport` on macOS, `MockSpiceStreamTransport` elsewhere. C shim properly creates SpiceSession and connects channel handlers. Frame delivery via shared memory + control channel matches documented architecture.
    - [X] Add C shim + pkg-config wiring for libspice-glib
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** Package.swift correctly uses conditional compilation for macOS-only libspice dependencies. CSpiceGlib systemLibrary properly configured with pkgConfig "spice-client-glib-2.0". C shim uses `#if __APPLE__` for conditional compilation.
    - [X] Implement reconnect/backoff + error metrics
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** ReconnectPolicy properly implements exponential backoff with configurable parameters. scheduleReconnect() uses DispatchWorkItem for cancellable delayed reconnect. Permanent failures (auth, shared memory) don't trigger reconnect.
    - [X] Switch host transport to shared memory (vhost-user)
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** environmentDefault() correctly prioritizes WINRUN_SPICE_SHM_FD for shared memory. C shim validates descriptor before use. Swift layer throws .sharedMemoryUnavailable for invalid descriptors (permanent failure, no reconnect).
    - [X] Implement Spice inputs channel integration (mouse + keyboard)
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** Mouse button mapping correctly converts to Spice button constants. Keyboard scan codes properly handle extended key flag (0x100 prefix). Horizontal scroll silently dropped (documented Spice protocol limitation).
    - [X] Implement Spice clipboard channel integration
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** Host→Guest clipboard push works via grab + notify pattern. Guest→Host data reception works via on_clipboard_data callback. RTF/HTML converted to plain text (documented Spice protocol limitation).
    - [X] Implement Spice file transfer for drag/drop
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** File transfer uses spice_main_channel_file_copy_async correctly. GFile cleanup in completion callback prevents memory leaks. Progress/error reporting not implemented (documented future enhancement).
  - [X] Virtualization lifecycle management
    - [X] Drive Virtualization.framework boot/stop/snapshot flows
      - **Status:** 🔧 Bugs found and fixed
      - **Bugs Fixed:**
        1. **Snapshot save/restore was stubbed out** - `NativeVirtualMachineBridge.saveMachineState` and `restoreMachineState` always threw errors. Fixed by implementing actual macOS 14+ Virtualization.framework APIs.
        2. **No VZVirtualMachineDelegate implementation** - VM controller had no way to detect unexpected VM stops. Fixed by adding `VirtualMachineDelegate` class.
      - **Design Shortcoming Noted:** Graceful shutdown uses forceful `vm.stop()`. Should use `vm.requestStop()` (ACPI power button) first with timeout fallback. Added to TODO.md.
    - [X] Persist VM disk/network configuration + validation
      - **Status:** 🔧 Bug found and fixed
      - **Bug Fixed:** **macAddress field stored but never applied** - `VMNetworkConfiguration.macAddress` was persisted but never used when building `VZVirtioNetworkDeviceConfiguration`. Fixed by applying via `VZMACAddress(string:)` in `buildNativeConfiguration()`.
      - **Improvements Added:** MAC address format validation with regex, new error case `VMConfigurationValidationError.invalidMACAddress(String)`.
    - [X] Emit uptime + session metrics to logger
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** `logMetrics(event:)` called at all 8 lifecycle points. VMMetricsSnapshot captures event, uptimeSeconds, activeSessions, totalSessions, bootCount, suspendCount. Logging infrastructure includes OSLogLogger, FileLogger, TelemetryLogger, CompositeLogger.
  - [X] Daemon + XPC integration
    - [X] Stand up XPC listener + connect CLI/app clients
      - **Status:** 🔧 Bugs found and fixed
      - **Bug 1 Fixed:** **Race condition in currentClientId handling** - `WinRunDaemonService.currentClientId` was a mutable `var` property that could be overwritten by concurrent XPC connections. When a connection set the property and then spawned a Task, another connection could overwrite it before the Task's `checkThrottle()` read it, causing rate limiting to be applied against the wrong client bucket.
        - **Fix:** Removed the shared mutable `currentClientId` property. Changed all service methods to accept `clientId` as an explicit parameter. `ConnectionServiceWrapper` now passes its immutable `clientId` to each method call.
      - **Bug 2 Fixed:** **Security bypass when group not found** - `verifyGroupMembership()` silently allowed connections if the configured group name didn't exist on the system. A misconfigured `allowedGroupName` (e.g., typo like "stafff") would bypass group authentication entirely.
        - **Fix:** Now throws `XPCAuthenticationError.connectionRejected` with a clear error message when the configured group is not found.
      - **Tests Added:** Comprehensive unit tests for `RateLimiter` actor including:
        - Token bucket behavior (first request succeeds, burst allowance)
        - Throttling when exceeding limits
        - Per-client bucket isolation
        - Cooldown enforcement
        - Metrics tracking
        - Stale client pruning
      - **Verified Safe:**
        - `VirtualMachineController` and `SpiceControlChannel` are both actors (thread-safe)
        - Timer for stale client pruning is properly retained by RunLoop
        - Mach service name in plist matches daemon code
        - Connection invalidation/interruption handlers properly set
    - [X] Enforce authentication + request throttling
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** Implementation is complete and correct:
        - Group membership verification via `getgrouplist()` with proper error handling for missing groups
        - Code signature verification via Security.framework (`SecCodeCopyGuestWithAttributes`, `SecCodeCheckValidity`)
        - Team identifier and bundle ID prefix checks implemented
        - Token bucket rate limiting with per-client buckets via `RateLimiter` actor
        - Cooldown enforcement after token exhaustion
        - Stale client pruning via hourly scheduled timer
        - `#if DEBUG` conditional compilation for dev vs production configs
      - **Test Coverage:** 39 tests covering error types, authentication config, throttling config, and RateLimiter behavior (burst allowance, cooldown, per-client isolation, metrics, pruning)
    - [X] Automate LaunchDaemon install/upgrade in bootstrap script
      - **Status:** 🔧 Bug found and fixed
      - **Bug Fixed:** **Deprecated launchctl command in error message** - `Errors.swift` line 413 used deprecated `launchctl load` in the recovery suggestion for `daemonUnreachable`. This is inconsistent with the modern `launchctl bootstrap` used in bootstrap.sh and docs/development.md.
        - **Fix:** Changed recovery suggestion to use `sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.winrun.daemon.plist`
      - **Verified Correct:**
        - plist file correctly configured (Label, MachServices, KeepAlive, RunAtLoad)
        - bootstrap.sh correctly uses `launchctl bootstrap` / `launchctl bootout`
        - Permissions set correctly (root:wheel, 644 for plist, 755 for binary)
        - MachServiceName consistent across plist, daemon, and XPC client (`com.winrun.daemon`)
        - Binary path consistent across plist and bootstrap.sh (`/usr/local/bin/winrund`)
    - [X] Implement real session listing backed by guest agent
      - **Status:** ✅ No bugs found
      - **Notes:** Full data flow traced from XPC client → daemon → control channel → guest → response. Protocol types match between host (Swift) and guest (C#) with consistent JSON serialization (camelCase). Session state enum values correctly serialize to lowercase strings. Message ID tracking for request/response pairing works correctly. Daemon gracefully returns empty list when control channel is unavailable. Test coverage includes serialization, deserialization, type conversions, and control channel request/response handling.
