# Host (macOS Swift) Rules

## Package Structure

This is a Swift Package with multiple targets. All host executables share common modules.

### Targets

| Target | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `WinRunShared` | Library | Config store, logging, error types, shared models |
| `WinRunXPC` | Library | XPC protocol definitions, async client |
| `WinRunVirtualMachine` | Library | Virtualization.framework wrapper, VM lifecycle |
| `WinRunSpiceBridge` | Library | Swift facade over libspice-glib via C shim |
| `CSpiceBridge` | C Target | Thin C wrapper for libspice-glib |
| `WinRunDaemon` | Executable | `winrund` - background daemon |
| `WinRunApp` | Executable | `WinRun.app` - per-window GUI |
| `WinRunCLI` | Executable | `winrun` - command-line tool |

### Dependencies Flow

```
WinRunDaemon ─┬─→ WinRunVirtualMachine ─→ WinRunShared
              ├─→ WinRunSpiceBridge ────→ CSpiceBridge
              ├─→ WinRunXPC ────────────→ WinRunShared
              └─→ WinRunShared

WinRunApp ────┬─→ WinRunSpiceBridge
              ├─→ WinRunXPC
              └─→ WinRunShared

WinRunCLI ────┬─→ WinRunXPC
              └─→ WinRunShared
```

## Swift Conventions

### Concurrency
- Use Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors) for all async operations
- `VirtualMachineController` should be an actor to serialize state transitions
- XPC interfaces expose async methods

### Error Handling
- Define domain-specific error enums in `WinRunShared`
- Propagate errors via throws; use Result only at API boundaries
- Include context in errors for debugging

### Logging
- Use `os_log` for production logging
- Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing

## Module-Specific Guidelines

### WinRunShared
- Contains: `Configuration`, `Logger`, `WinRunError`, shared models
- No dependencies on other WinRun modules
- Platform-agnostic where possible for testing

### WinRunXPC
- Define XPC protocols with `@objc` for compatibility
- Use Codable models for request/response payloads
- Include version fields for protocol evolution

### WinRunVirtualMachine
- Wrap all Virtualization.framework calls
- Validate configuration before applying
- Emit metrics for boot duration, uptime, session counts

### WinRunSpiceBridge
- Swift facade over `CSpiceBridge` C target
- Expose async streams for frames and metadata
- Handle reconnection with exponential backoff
- Support both shared-memory (production) and TCP (fallback) transports

### CSpiceBridge
- Minimal C code wrapping libspice-glib
- Focus on session management, buffer lifecycle, callback forwarding
- Use pkg-config for libspice-glib linkage

### WinRunDaemon
- Entry point for `winrund`
- Set up XPC listener, VM controller, Spice server
- Handle signals for graceful shutdown
- Integrate with launchd lifecycle

### WinRunApp
- One instance per Windows window
- Metal-backed rendering of Spice frames
- Forward input events to Spice
- Sync NSWindow properties with guest window metadata

### WinRunCLI
- Argument parsing via ArgumentParser
- Connect to daemon via XPC
- Commands: vm (start/stop/status), launch, create-launcher, config

## Testing

- Test files in `Tests/` mirror source structure
- Use XCTest framework
- Mock external dependencies (Virtualization, Spice) for unit tests
- Integration tests can use process spawning

## Build Commands

```bash
# Debug build
swift build

# Release build
swift build -c release

# Run tests
swift test

# Build specific target
swift build --target WinRunDaemon
```

## Key Decision Documents

- `docs/decisions/spice-bridge.md` — Binding strategy, transport selection
- `docs/decisions/virtualization.md` — VM lifecycle, boot/suspend policies
- `docs/decisions/protocols.md` — XPC contracts, Spice payload schemas
